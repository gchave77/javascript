//Complete the following 7 coding problems below: 

// Problem 1:
// Part 1: Write a JavaScript program that converts the current temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Declare a variable for the current temperature then store the Celsius temperature into a variable. Console log the variable.

// Part 2: Write another program that converts the Celsius temperature back to Fahrenheit. 

//your code...






/************************************************************* */

// Write a JavaScript program to determine if someone is old enough to vote. Declare a variable for age and write a conditional statement for whether that age is old enough to vote. Console log "yes" or "no"

//your code...

// Write a JavaScript program that converts a string to an array. Declare a string variable with "The five boxing wizards jump quickly." Use the split() method to turn the string into an array of strings. (Be sure you separate the string into words, not characters.) After you have finished, use the join() method to change the array back into a string.

//your code...







/************************************************************* */
// Problem 4:
// Write a JavaScript program with a function that reverses your telephone number. Use the split() and join() methods from the previous problem as well as the toString() method to convert a number into a string and reverse() method to reverse an array in place.

//your code...





/************************************************************* */
// Problem 5:
// Write a JavaScript program creates a car object using information about your car. Include the make, model, year, and color. Write a function to get the year, color, make, and model in that order.

//your code...






/************************************************************* */
// Problem 6:
// Write a JavaScript program with a loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. Each iteration, the for loop will check if the current number is odd or even and display the output.


//your code...




/************************************************************* */
// Problem 7:
// Write a JavaScript program that iterates the integers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

//your code...
