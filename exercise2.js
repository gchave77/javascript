//Complete the following 6 coding problems below: 

/************************************************************* */
// Problem 1:
// Create a function constructor for a Dog object with parameters breed, color, and age. Then create a function with the prototype property that outputs the age in human years (multiple by 7). Once finished, instantiate two new objects by passing in arguments and access the function for human years.



//your code...






/************************************************************* */
// Problem 2:
// Recreate your Dog object using the Object.create method by first defining your prototype object and then instantiating your first object based on that prototype.

//your code...






/************************************************************* */
// Problem 3:
// Write a function called multiple that has one parameter (x). Inside that function, create another function called fn with one parameter (y) that returns the product of both parameters (x,y). The multiple function should return its inner function. Now create a variable called triple. Use triple to console log some multiples of three.

//your code...






/************************************************************* */
// Problem 4:
// Write a function that adds two decimals and returns the value rounded to the nearest integer. Once finished, refactor your function into an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). Remember to enclose your function in parentheses and include some additional parentheses at the end.

//your code...






/************************************************************* */
// Problem 5:
// Start by writing an outer function called stockGain that has cost basis (basis) as a parameter; declare a variable called message that holds " is how much the stock has increased".  Return an inner function with years (yrs) as a parameter and declare a variable for growth rate (r) of 5%. Console log your calculation.

// Once finished, declare a variable called futureValue that holds your stockGain function and enter any amount for the cost basis and a number for the number of years.  Run the function returned by the higher order function to display the future value of the stock.  

//your code...






/************************************************************* */
// Problem 6:
// Create a function constructor for a Student object with the parameters firstName and lastName. Then write a function that concatenates firstName and lastName and returns the full name. Once finished, declare a variable called studentName that holds a function with two parameters: grade and major. Console log the full name with the grade and major. 

// Next declare another variable recordStudent that holds studentName with the bind() method. Use the call() and apply() methods as well. 

//your code...
